Cricket/NN is/VBZ a/DT bat-and-ball/JJ game/NN played/VBN between/IN two/CD teams/NNS of/IN eleven/CD players/NNS each/DT on/IN a/DT cricket/NN field/NN ,/, at/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT rectangular/JJ 22-yard-long/JJ pitch/NN with/IN a/DT target/NN called/VBN the/DT wicket/NN -LRB-/-LRB- a/DT set/NN of/IN three/CD wooden/JJ stumps/NNS topped/VBN by/IN two/CD bails/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- at/IN each/DT end/NN ./.

Each/DT phase/NN of/IN play/NN is/VBZ called/VBN an/DT innings/NNS during/IN which/WDT one/CD team/NN bats/NNS ,/, attempting/VBG to/TO score/NN as/IN many/DT runs/VBZ as/RB possible/JJ ,/, whilst/VBZ their/PRP$ opponents/NNS field/NN ./.

Depending/VBG on/IN the/DT type/NN of/IN match/NN ,/, the/DT teams/NNS have/VBP one/CD or/CC two/CD innings/NNS apiece/RB and/CC ,/, when/WRB the/DT first/JJ innings/NNS ends/VBZ ,/, the/DT teams/NNS swap/VBP roles/NNS for/IN the/DT next/JJ innings/NNS ./.

Except/IN in/IN matches/NNP which/WDT result/VBP in/IN a/DT draw/NN ,/, the/DT winning/JJ team/NN is/VBZ the/DT one/NN that/WDT scores/VBZ the/DT most/JJS runs/NNS ,/, including/VBG any/DT extras/NNS gained/VBN ./.

Before/IN a/DT match/NN begins/VBZ ,/, the/DT two/CD team/NN captains/NNS meet/VBP on/IN the/DT pitch/NN for/IN the/DT toss/NN -LRB-/-LRB- of/IN a/DT coin/NN -RRB-/-RRB- to/TO determine/VB which/WDT team/NN will/MD bat/VB first/RB ./.

Two/CD batsmen/NN and/CC eleven/CD fielders/NNS then/RB enter/VBP the/DT field/NN and/CC play/NN begins/VBZ when/WRB a/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT fielding/NN team/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN the/DT bowler/NN ,/, delivers/VBZ the/DT ball/NN from/IN one/CD end/NN of/IN the/DT pitch/NN towards/IN the/DT wicket/NN at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ guarded/VBN by/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT batsmen/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN the/DT striker/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT bowler/NN ,/, the/DT fielding/NN team/NN includes/VBZ the/DT wicket-keeper/NN ,/, a/DT specialist/NN who/WP stands/VBZ behind/IN the/DT striker/NN 's/POS wicket/NN ./.

The/DT nine/CD other/JJ fielders/NNS are/VBP tactically/RB deployed/VBN around/IN the/DT field/NN by/IN their/PRP$ captain/NN ,/, usually/RB in/IN consultation/NN with/IN the/DT bowler/NN ./.

The/DT striker/NN ``/`` takes/VBZ guard/NNP ''/'' on/IN a/DT crease/NN drawn/VBN on/IN the/DT pitch/NN four/CD feet/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT wicket/NN ./.

His/PRP$ role/NN is/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB the/DT ball/NN from/IN hitting/VBG the/DT stumps/NNS by/IN using/VBG his/PRP$ bat/NN and/CC ,/, simultaneously/RB ,/, to/TO strike/VB it/PRP well/RB enough/RB to/TO score/NN runs/NNS ./.

The/DT other/JJ batsman/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN the/DT non-striker/NN ,/, waits/VBZ at/IN the/DT opposite/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT pitch/NN near/IN the/DT bowler/NN ./.

The/DT bowler/NN 's/POS objectives/NNS are/VBP to/TO prevent/VB the/DT scoring/VBG of/IN runs/NNS and/CC to/TO dismiss/VB the/DT batsman/NN ./.

A/DT dismissed/JJ batsman/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ declared/VBN to/TO be/VB out/RP ,/, must/MD leave/VB the/DT field/NN to/TO be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN a/DT teammate/NN ./.

An/DT over/RB is/VBZ a/DT set/NN of/IN six/CD deliveries/NNS bowled/VBN by/IN the/DT same/JJ bowler/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ over/RB is/VBZ bowled/VBN from/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT pitch/NN by/IN a/DT different/JJ bowler/NN ./.

The/DT most/RBS common/JJ forms/NNS of/IN dismissal/NN are/VBP bowled/VBN ,/, when/WRB the/DT bowler/NN hits/VBZ the/DT stumps/NNS directly/RB with/IN the/DT ball/NN and/CC dislodges/VBZ the/DT bails/NNS ;/: leg/NN before/IN wicket/NN -LRB-/-LRB- lbw/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, when/WRB the/DT batsman/NN prevents/VBZ the/DT ball/NN from/IN hitting/VBG the/DT stumps/NNS with/IN his/PRP$ body/NN instead/RB of/IN his/PRP$ bat/NN ;/: and/CC caught/VBN ,/, when/WRB the/DT batsman/NN hits/VBZ the/DT ball/NN into/IN the/DT air/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ intercepted/VBN by/IN a/DT fielder/NN before/IN touching/VBG the/DT ground/NN ./.

Runs/NNS are/VBP scored/VBN by/IN two/CD main/JJ methods/NNS :/: either/CC by/IN hitting/VBG the/DT ball/NN hard/JJ enough/RB for/IN it/PRP to/TO cross/VB the/DT boundary/NN ,/, or/CC by/IN the/DT two/CD batsmen/NN swapping/VBG ends/NNS by/IN each/DT simultaneously/RB running/VBG the/DT length/NN of/IN the/DT pitch/NN in/IN opposite/JJ directions/NNS whilst/IN the/DT fielders/NNS are/VBP retrieving/VBG the/DT ball/NN ./.

If/IN a/DT fielder/NN retrieves/VBZ the/DT ball/NN quickly/RB enough/RB to/TO put/VB down/RP the/DT wicket/NN with/IN a/DT batsman/NN not/RB having/VBG reached/VBN the/DT crease/NN at/IN that/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT pitch/NN ,/, that/DT batsman/NN is/VBZ dismissed/VBN -LRB-/-LRB- a/DT run/NN out/RB occurs/VBZ -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Adjudication/NNP is/VBZ performed/VBN on/IN the/DT field/NN by/IN two/CD umpires/NNS ;/: they/PRP communicate/VB with/IN two/CD off-field/JJ scorers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- one/CD per/IN team/NN -RRB-/-RRB- who/WP record/VB all/DT the/DT match/NN 's/POS statistical/JJ information/NN including/VBG runs/NNS ,/, dismissals/NNS ,/, overs/NNS ,/, etc./FW ./.

In/IN cricket/NN 's/POS case/NN ,/, a/DT key/JJ difference/NN is/VBZ the/DT existence/NN of/IN a/DT solid/JJ target/NN structure/NN ,/, the/DT wicket/NN -LRB-/-LRB- originally/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ thought/VBN ,/, a/DT ``/`` wicket/JJ gate/NN ''/'' through/IN which/WDT sheep/NN were/VBD herded/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, that/IN the/DT batsman/NN must/MD defend/VB ./.

The/DT cricket/NN historian/VBZ Harry/NNP Altham/NNP identified/VBN three/CD ``/`` groups/NNS ''/'' of/IN ``/`` club/NNP ball/NNP ''/'' games/NNS :/: the/DT ``/`` hockey/NN group/NN ''/'' ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT ball/NN is/VBZ driven/VBN to/TO and/CC fro/RB between/IN two/CD targets/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT goals/NNS -RRB-/-RRB- ;/: the/DT ``/`` golf/NN group/NN ''/'' ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT ball/NN is/VBZ driven/VBN towards/IN an/DT undefended/JJ target/NN -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT hole/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ;/: and/CC the/DT ``/`` cricket/NN group/NN ''/'' ,/, in/IN which/WDT ``/`` the/DT ball/NN is/VBZ aimed/VBN at/IN a/DT mark/NN -LRB-/-LRB- the/DT wicket/NN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC driven/VBN away/RP from/IN it/PRP ''/'' ./.

It/PRP is/VBZ generally/RB believed/VBN that/IN cricket/NN originated/VBN as/IN a/DT children/NNS 's/POS game/NN in/IN the/DT south-eastern/JJ counties/NNS of/IN England/NNP ,/, sometime/RB during/IN the/DT medieval/JJ period/NN ./.

Although/IN there/EX are/VBP claims/NNS for/IN prior/JJ dates/NNS ,/, the/DT earliest/JJS definite/JJ reference/NN to/TO cricket/NN being/VBG played/VBN comes/VBZ from/IN evidence/NN given/VBN at/IN a/DT court/NN case/NN in/IN Guildford/NNP on/IN Monday/NNP ,/, 17/CD January/NNP 1597/CD -LRB-/-LRB- Julian/VBG calendar/NN ;/: equating/VBG to/TO 30/CD January/NNP 1598/CD in/IN the/DT Gregorian/NNP calendar/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

The/DT case/NN concerned/VBN ownership/NN of/IN a/DT certain/JJ plot/NN of/IN land/NN and/CC the/DT court/NN heard/VBD the/DT testimony/NN of/IN a/DT 59-year-old/JJ coroner/NN ,/, John/NNP Derrick/NNP ,/, who/WP gave/VBD witness/NN that/DT :/: ``/`` Being/VBG a/DT scholler/NN in/IN the/DT ffree/JJ schoole/NN of/IN Guldeford/NNP hee/NNP and/CC diverse/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ fellows/NNS did/VBD runne/NN and/CC play/NN there/RB at/IN creckett/NN and/CC other/JJ plaies/NNS ''/'' ./.

The/DT view/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD originally/RB a/DT children/NNS 's/POS game/NN is/VBZ reinforced/VBN by/IN Randle/NNP Cotgrave/NNP 's/POS 1611/CD English-French/JJ dictionary/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PRP defined/VBD the/DT noun/NN ``/`` crosse/FW ''/'' as/IN ``/`` the/DT crooked/JJ staff/NN wherewith/NNP boys/NNPS play/VBP at/IN cricket/NN ''/'' and/CC the/DT verb/NN form/VBP ``/`` crosser/NNP ''/'' as/RB ``/`` to/TO play/VB at/IN cricket/NN ''/'' ./.

One/CD possible/JJ source/NN for/IN the/DT sport/NN 's/POS name/NN is/VBZ the/DT Old/JJ English/JJ word/NN ``/`` cryce/NN ''/'' -LRB-/-LRB- or/CC ``/`` cricc/NNP ''/'' -RRB-/-RRB- meaning/VBG a/DT crutch/NN or/CC staff/NN ./.

In/IN Samuel/NNP Johnson/NNP 's/POS Dictionary/NN ,/, he/PRP derived/VBD cricket/NN from/IN ``/`` cryce/NNP ,/, Saxon/NNP ,/, a/DT stick/NN ''/'' ./.

In/IN Old/NNP French/NNP ,/, the/DT word/NN ``/`` criquet/NN ''/'' seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB meant/VBN a/DT kind/NN of/IN club/NNP or/CC stick/NNP ./.

Given/VBN the/DT strong/JJ medieval/JJ trade/NN connections/NNS between/IN south-east/NNP England/NNP and/CC the/DT County/NN of/IN Flanders/NNS when/WRB the/DT latter/NN belonged/VBD to/TO the/DT Duchy/NN of/IN Burgundy/NNP ,/, the/DT name/NN may/MD have/VB been/VBN derived/VBN from/IN the/DT Middle/NNP Dutch/NNPS -LRB-/-LRB- in/IN use/NN in/IN Flanders/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ``/`` krick/NNP ''/'' -LRB-/-LRB- -/NNP e/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, meaning/VBG a/DT stick/NN -LRB-/-LRB- crook/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Another/DT possible/JJ source/NN is/VBZ the/DT Middle/JJ Dutch/JJ word/NN ``/`` krickstoel/NN ''/'' ,/, meaning/VBG a/DT long/JJ low/JJ stool/NN used/VBN for/IN kneeling/VBG in/IN church/NN and/CC which/WDT resembled/VBD the/DT long/JJ low/JJ wicket/NN with/IN two/CD stumps/NNS used/VBN in/IN early/JJ cricket/NN ./.

According/VBG to/TO Heiner/NNP Gillmeister/NNP ,/, a/DT European/JJ language/NN expert/NN of/IN Bonn/NNP University/NNP ,/, ``/`` cricket/NN ''/'' derives/VBZ from/IN the/DT Middle/JJ Dutch/JJ phrase/NN for/IN hockey/NN ,/, met/NNP de/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- krik/NNP ket/NNP -RRB-/-RRB- sen/NNP -LRB-/-LRB- i.e./VBN ,/, ``/`` with/IN the/DT stick/NNP chase/NNP ''/'' -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

Although/IN the/DT main/JJ object/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN to/TO score/VB the/DT most/JJS runs/NNS ,/, the/DT early/JJ form/NN of/IN cricket/NN differed/VBN from/IN the/DT modern/JJ game/NN in/IN certain/JJ key/JJ technical/JJ aspects/NNS ./.

The/DT ball/NN was/VBD bowled/VBN underarm/NN by/IN the/DT bowler/NN and/CC all/DT along/IN the/DT ground/NN towards/IN a/DT batsman/NNP armed/NNP with/IN a/DT bat/NN that/WDT ,/, in/IN shape/NN ,/, resembled/VBD a/DT hockey/NN stick/VBP ;/: the/DT batsman/NN defended/VBD a/DT low/JJ ,/, two-stump/JJ wicket/NN ;/: and/CC runs/NNS were/VBD called/VBN ``/`` notches/NNS ''/'' because/IN the/DT scorers/NNS recorded/VBD them/PRP by/IN notching/VBG tally/NN sticks/VBZ ./.
